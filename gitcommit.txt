#NEXT COMMIT MESSAGE:

Created signup.php file that allows users to sign up if they have no account.
Added a link to this page on both error messages in login.php, the one that shows if the user cancels the log in, and the one that shows if the user enters an incorrect username and/or incorrect password. Tested and works as it should.
