#NEXT COMMIT MESSAGE:

Line 76 of questionnaire.php:
Changed this:
($response['response'] == NULL ? 'class="error"' : '')
To this:
($response['response'] == 0 ? 'class="error"' : '')
When a question was unanswered, the error class was not being set, after looking into it it seems the default value for the unanswered response column set by the script is 0, and not NULL.
